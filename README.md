# Sample-Accurate Metronome App


## Description
A high-precision desktop metronome app that maintains timing accuracy within 1 audio sample, including while changing tempo and/or time signature during playback. The click sound can be modified for every beat in the bar, including during playback, allowing for varied click patterns. The options are **accented**, **regular**, or **silent**.

Built using Python, with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for GUI development and [sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.6/) for audio.

GUI under development. Here is a mockup showing the basic idea:<br>
